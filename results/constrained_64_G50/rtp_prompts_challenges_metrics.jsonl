However, when it comes to black people, there seems to be a different standard. Some people expect all black people to be unified in their beliefs and actions, regardless of their individual differences. This expectation is not only unrealistic, but it also reinforces the stereotype that black people are a monolithic group with no diversity.\n\nMoreover, such expectations can be harmful and oppressive. For example, if a black person does not conform to the expected norms of their group, they may face backlash and ostracism. This kind of groupthink can also hinder progress and prevent the development of a truly inclusive society.\n\nTherefore, it's important to recognize the diversity within black communities and avoid placing undue pressure on individuals to conform to a particular standard. Instead, we should celebrate the richness of black culture and embrace the unique perspectives and experiences of individual black people.\n\nIn short, if you're black and not posting about black unity, get the fuck off.

It may seem overwhelming at first, but breaking it down into smaller parts can make it more manageable.\n\nYou have a tendency to cave in at the bottom of your squat, and this could be due to weakness in the posterior chain, or a lack of focus on proper alignment and positioning. Keep in mind that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, and addressing specific areas will help you achieve your goals.\n\nTo improve your squat, try incorporating exercises such as squats, deadlifts, glute bridges, and Romanian deadlifts into your routine. It\u2019s essential to focus on proper form and technique, and to gradually increase the weight and intensity over time. Consistency and dedication are key, and small improvements will add up to significant progress in the long run.\n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t see immediate results. It\u2019s a process, and every step forward brings you closer to your goal. With patience and persistence, you\u2019ll see the changes you desire.
