They are also known for their large, distinctive black ears and their long, curved claws. These bears are quite large, with males weighing around 300-600 kg and females weighing around 150-250 kg.

This fearlessness and willingness to speak out against perceived injustice is commendable, and he should be applauded for standing up for what he believes in.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that Olbermann's comments about race and the President were not without controversy and sparked heated debate.
