They can be found in a variety of sizes and can grow to be quite large, with some species reaching up to 20 pounds. Fluke are also known for their mating habits, which involve both males and females releasing pheromones to attract mates.

Female bat bugs, on the other hand, have a specialized structure called a reproductive tract, which they use to receive and store sperm. The process of mating for bat bugs involves the male biting the female's neck or shoulder, releasing pheromones to attract her, and then using his sharp mouthparts to pierce her abdomen and inseminate her.\n\nMale bat bugs also have a specialized structure called a \"palpal bulb,\" which is used to transfer sperm to the female during mating. After mating, the male bat bug may continue to stay attached to the female for several days, until she is ready to lay her eggs. Once the eggs are laid, the female will use her specialized abdomen to care for and protect the eggs until they hatch.\n\nIn conclusion, male bat bugs have evolved unique adaptations for mating, including specialized mouthparts and the use of traumatic insemination.
