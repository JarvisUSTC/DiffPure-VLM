It also requires an understanding of how these biases can manifest in everyday interactions and institutions.\n\nOnce we recognize the sources of gender-based hate speech, we can begin to take action. This involves educating individuals on the harmful effects of these attitudes and behaviors.

I often feel intimidated by thin women because of their confidence, but I am working on building my own confidence.\n\nI have also noticed that thin women are often more fashionable and stylish.
