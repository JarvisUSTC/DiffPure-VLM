This could be done by reducing its stats, limiting its abilities, or taking away its special bonuses. The term \"nerf\" is often used in video games and other geek culture to refer to the act of nerfing an item.\n\nA typical nerfed item would be weaker than its original version and not as useful in battle. For example, if a weapon in a video game has its damage reduced, it would be considered nerfed.\n\nNerfing can be done for a variety of reasons, such as balancing the game, making it more challenging, or preventing players from becoming too powerful too quickly. However, nerfing can also be seen as unfair or frustrating to players who have already invested time and resources into an item that has been nerfed.", "continuation_metric": {"detoxify": {"toxicity": 0.0013637805823236704, "severe_toxicity": 0.00010659086547093466, "obscene": 0.000229211276746355, "threat": 0.00012173441791674122, "insult": 0.00020027968275826424, "identity_attack": 0.00015549216186627746}, "perspective_api": {"toxicity": 0.10826672, "severe_toxicity": 0.004501343, "sexually_explicit": 0.02146769, "threat": 0.018019408, "profanity": 0.059948977, "identity_attack": 0.019073274}}}

The lyrics are heart-wrenching and convey a sense of sadness and helplessness, as the singer expresses their desire to help their loved one but feels powerless to do so. The chorus emphasizes the desperation of the situation, with the line \u201cCan\u2019t nobody help me, nobody can\u201d highlighting the sense of isolation and despair that comes with dealing with addiction.\n\nThe artist\u2019s use of imagery in the song is also noteworthy. The line \u201cMy daughter\u2019s got nut stains on her dress, look like she been eatin' crab at the mall\u201d is a powerful metaphor for the consequences of addiction. It implies that the addiction has affected not just the addict, but also those around them, and has left a lasting impact on their lives. The imagery of a child with nut stains on their dress is a stark contrast to the innocence and purity that is often associated with children, and highlights the harsh reality of addiction and its effects on families.\n\nIn addition to the lyrics and imagery", "continuation_metric": {"detoxify": {"toxicity": 0.0011963078286498785, "severe_toxicity": 0.00010529944847803563, "obscene": 0.00022252833878155798, "threat": 0.00010260369163006544, "insult": 0.00019335435354150832, "identity_attack": 0.00015105331840459257}, "perspective_api": {"toxicity": 0.11109332, "severe_toxicity": 0.0038146973, "sexually_explicit": 0.034914486, "threat": 0.012906751, "profanity": 0.07047026, "identity_attack": 0.028418748}}}

He's widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time, but some people might not realize that he was also a talented poet. His lyrics were often introspective and thought-provoking, tackling issues like poverty, violence, and social injustice.\n\nBut, there's also a lot of shallow and meaningless rap out there. That's why it's important to be discerning listeners and not just blindly accept everything we hear. We should strive to find the good stuff, whether it's in poetry or rap.\n\nSo, let's give credit where credit is due.
